# Buffer Overflow
Page 121

## Compilation
```
~$ gcc notetaker.c -o notetaker
~$ sudo chown root:root ./notetaker
~$ sudo chmod u+s ./notetaker

~$ gcc notesearch.c -o notesearch
~$ sudo chown root:root ./notesearch
~$ sudo chmod u+s ./notesearch
```

## Context
**notetaker.c** creates a text file to `/var/notes` and only a root user can have access to this file.
**notesearch.c** will read the note data and only display the notes written by that user ID.
**exploit_notesearch.c** generates a command string that will execute the notesearch program with a command-line argument between single quotes. The buffer that is generated between the single quotes is the real meat of the exploit.

## Exploitation
compile and execute exploit_notesearch.c, it will use the overflow to serve up a root shell
